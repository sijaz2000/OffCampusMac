# OffCampus@Mac

A web application designed to help Macalester Students find off-campus housing easily. 

Using the application, Macalester students already living off-campus can lease or sublet their housing to newer students moving off-campus. This minimizes the stress and anxiety a lot of people face when looking for new places as both parties have a college connection with each other.

The application uses React, Javascript, and Google Firebase for frontend, backend, and database respectively. The application is also hosted using Firebase. Google OAuth was also used to ensure only people with a `@macalester.edu` email could log in.
